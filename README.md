**Cinema Finder Project Bug Resolution Report**

**Date:** October 16, 2023

**Author:** Marianela Mu√±oz Gutierrez

**Summary:**

The purpose of this report is to document the resolution of a bug found in the Cinema Finder project. The bug in question was related to the zoom and focus functionality of the map when clicking on the GPS marker in the list of cinemas. The correction was implemented following the guidelines provided by the Leaflet documentation and was applied to the "LeafletMap.jsx" and "CinemaListItem.jsx" components.

**Solution Details:**

1. **Fork of the Original Project:**

To address the bug and conduct tests, a fork of the original project was created on CodeSandbox. This allowed us to work in isolation on the solution and ensure that it did not affect the main project.

2. **Implemented Solution:**

The implemented solution is available and functional at the following link: [Cinema Finder on CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/cinema-finder-datacom-marianela-gwxysm).

3. **Bug Description:**

The reported bug occurred when clicking on the GPS marker in the list of cinemas. Previously, the map did not properly zoom or focus on the location of the corresponding cinema. This incorrect behavior was due to an error in the Leaflet implementation.

4. **Cause of the Bug:**

The cause of the bug was found in the misinterpretation of the Leaflet documentation. According to the Leaflet documentation (https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#map-flyto), the longitude (lng) and latitude (lat) values should be passed in that order. However, in the project's code, they were passed in the reverse order, resulting in the incorrect zoom and focus of the map when clicking on the GPS markers in the cinema list.

5. **Correction of Components:**

The bug correction involved modifying two specific components of the project:

- **LeafletMap.jsx:** In this component, the necessary correction was made to ensure that the longitude (lng) and latitude (lat) values were passed in the correct order, following the guidelines of the Leaflet documentation.

- **CinemaListItem.jsx:** This component was adjusted to ensure that the coordinates (lng, lat) were passed in the correct order to the LeafletMap.jsx component when clicking on a GPS marker in the cinema list.

**Conclusions:**

The bug correction in the Cinema Finder project was carried out following the guidelines of the Leaflet documentation. The "LeafletMap.jsx" and "CinemaListItem.jsx" components were modified so that the longitude and latitude values were passed in the correct order, resolving the issue of zoom and focus of the map when clicking on the GPS markers in the cinema list.
